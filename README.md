First github repo of my favorite food!
In this very new website I will showcase the best food in the world: mofongo de churrasco (steak)
This delicious dish hails from Puerto Rico, my homeland. 
I will not only get you the best picture of what a true mofongo looks like, but I will also show you how to make it! It is not that hard, but most of the flavor will be reliant on the state of the plantains used. Let's dig in!
